# Karst

This Template has been prepared for our convenience. Its ground is seemingly deserted though, but whispers the wisdoms in its depths (Even though not `mine`). Yes, like a karst plateau.

## Usage

-   We can simply use this as a template for svelte SPA app.
-   If we add `src/pages/*.svelte` files, we can use this as a template of svelte MPA app. Each page will be created as a separate html file, as following the lower-case of each file name into the `pages` directory.
-   And, I am going to add some more features like creating WebComponents, etc. in the future.
